# Hello, I'm Ben.

I'm an aspiring junior developer based in Prague. After over ten years working as a teacher, I decided to take the plunge and study full-stack web development at a coding bootcamp. After the bootcamp, I have coded some portfolio projects and worked on gaining both front-end and back-end certification from Meta on the Coursera platform. I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute to projects which make a meaningful impact. I amm ooking for an opportunity to join a company where I can grow and learn as a developer and where I can put my skills to use in real-world projects.
